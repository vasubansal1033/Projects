Didn't know myArray = [1, 2, 3]
myArray2 = myArray // shallow copy
myArray3 = [...myArray] // deep copy

Was manually removing from array
got to know about filter
using splice to remove first element of array
but it wasnt working

forgot to pass empty array while first parsing local storage
JSON.parse(senfj) || []

after implementing sorting for both rating and popularity
didn't set the order variable of other one to 0.
